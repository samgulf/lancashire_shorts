    <h1>Lancashire Shorts</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Lancashire Shorts.
      Short audio plays, conceived, written and produced in Lancashire.
      The plays cover a wide variety of genres, (not horror) and are intended to provide light and humorous entertainment.
      The plays are free to listen to, but we hope you might consider making a small donation, via Ko-Fi, to a special Lancashire charity we support.
      We hope you do enjoy them.  We are keen to add plenty more as finances allow!
      Phil and the team
